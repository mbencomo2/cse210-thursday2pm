# jumper
Experience the thrill of skydiving!<i>Jumper</i> is similar to hangman but with a twist. 
The rules are simple. The player attempts to guess what the word chosen is, and each wrong letter causes part of your
parachute to break! Guessing continues until the either you guess the word correctly, or your parachute breaks.
