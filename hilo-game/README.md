# High or Lo?
The rules are simple. Draw a card, and guess if the next card will be higher or lower in value. Guess correctly to eary 100 points, but guess incorrectly and lose 75 points. As long as you have points left you can continue playing. See how many rounds you can go!

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 cards
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- cards                (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (program entry point)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
