# Greed
---
He who is not contented with what he has, would not be contented with what he would like to have.-Socrates-

Greed is a game in which the player seeks to gather as many falling gems as possible. There are two speeds of falling gems, and the faster ones offer twice as many points. Do you give in and take the risk? The game continues as long as the player wants more! 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install 
Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by 
running the following command.
```
python3 greed 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Controls
---
The player is represented by '#', and is controlled with the left and right arrow keys. You can wrap off the screen and appear on the other side (portals!).

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- greed               (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
